It is used for dimensionality reduction.  
So we have to get rid of non important feature, to increase speed and efficiency of model  
PCA is a process of figuring out most important features

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a dimensionality reduction technique used in data analysis to simplify complex datasets. The primary goal of PCA is to reduce the number of variables (features) while retaining the most important information in the data.

PCA works by transforming the original correlated features into a new set of uncorrelated features called **principal components**. These principal components are ordered such that the first few retain most of the variance present in the original dataset. 

Key points about PCA:
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of features while maintaining the overall variance.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies new features (principal components) that capture the most significant patterns in the data.
3. **Orthogonal Transformation**: The principal components are orthogonal (uncorrelated) to each other.
4. **Variance Maximization**: The first principal component has the highest variance, the second has the second highest, and so on.

PCA is commonly used in machine learning, image processing, and other fields to simplify data, reduce noise, and improve computational efficiency.
