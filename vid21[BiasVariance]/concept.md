**Bias** and **variance** are two key concepts in machine learning that describe the types of errors made by models. Understanding the trade-off between bias and variance is crucial for building models that generalize well to new, unseen data.

### 1. **Bias**
- **Definition**: Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. It is the difference between the average prediction of the model and the correct output values.
- **Characteristics**:
  - A high-bias model is too simplistic and makes strong assumptions about the data. 
  - Such a model will not capture the underlying patterns well, leading to **underfitting**.
  - For example, a linear model might have high bias when trying to fit a complex, non-linear dataset.
- **Impact**: High bias leads to errors on both training and test data, resulting in poor predictive performance.

### 2. **Variance**
- **Definition**: Variance refers to the error due to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. It represents the amount by which the model's predictions change if it were trained on a different subset of the data.
- **Characteristics**:
  - A high-variance model is too complex and overly sensitive to the specific details of the training data.
  - Such a model will capture noise along with the underlying patterns, leading to **overfitting**.
  - For example, a model with many parameters, like a deep neural network, can have high variance when trained on a small dataset.
- **Impact**: High variance leads to low errors on the training data but high errors on the test data because the model fails to generalize well.

### **Bias-Variance Trade-off**
- There is a trade-off between bias and variance: reducing one typically increases the other.
  - **High Bias, Low Variance**: A simple model that underfits (e.g., a linear regression model on non-linear data).
  - **Low Bias, High Variance**: A complex model that overfits (e.g., a decision tree with many splits on a small dataset).
- The goal is to find the right balance where both bias and variance are minimized to achieve good generalization to new data.

In summary, **bias** measures the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model, while **variance** measures the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to training data. Balancing bias and variance is key to building effective machine-learning models.
