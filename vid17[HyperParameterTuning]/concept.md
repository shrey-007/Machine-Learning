**Hyperparameter tuning** (or hyperparameter optimization) is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to maximize its performance. 

### What Are Hyperparameters?
- **Hyperparameters** are the parameters of the model that are not learned from the data but are set before the learning process begins. These include parameters like learning rate, number of layers in a neural network, number of trees in a random forest, maximum depth of a tree, regularization parameter, etc.
- Unlike model parameters (like weights in a neural network), hyperparameters directly control the training process and the structure of the model.

### Why Hyperparameter Tuning?
The choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of a machine learning model. Proper tuning of hyperparameters is essential to:
- Improve model accuracy.
- Prevent overfitting or underfitting.
- Reduce the training time.
  
### Methods for Hyperparameter Tuning

1. **Grid Search**:
   - This is an exhaustive search technique where you specify a set of possible values for each hyperparameter and then train and evaluate the model for every possible combination.
   - It's simple and guarantees finding the best combination, but it can be computationally expensive, especially when the number of hyperparameters or their ranges is large.

2. **Random Search**:
   - Instead of searching exhaustively, random search selects random combinations of hyperparameters to train the model.
   - This approach is more efficient than grid search in high-dimensional spaces and often finds a good set of hyperparameters faster.

3. **Bayesian Optimization**:
   - This is a more sophisticated method that builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameters to the model performance.
   - It iteratively selects the hyperparameters that are expected to improve the model based on past evaluations. This approach balances exploration and exploitation, making it more sample-efficient than grid or random search.

4. **Genetic Algorithms**:
   - A population-based optimization method inspired by natural selection, where a set of hyperparameters is treated as an individual, and their performance represents their fitness. The best-performing combinations are "mated" to create new sets, evolving over time to find an optimal set.

5. **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**:
   - Some tools and libraries (like AutoML frameworks) perform automated hyperparameter tuning by combining several methods to optimize the model in a more hands-off manner.
